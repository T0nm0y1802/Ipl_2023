# IPL 2023 Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 season using various data analytics techniques. The data is gathered through web scraping using Beautiful Soup, followed by data cleaning and analysis using SQL and Power BI. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into the performance of batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders throughout the tournament.

## Tools Used

- **Beautiful Soup**: Python library for web scraping.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Power BI**: Business intelligence tool for data visualization and analysis.

## Data Collection

Data for this project is collected by scraping various IPL 2023 statistics websites using Beautiful Soup. The scraped data includes match results, player statistics, and team performance metrics.

## Data Cleaning

After scraping the data, it undergoes cleaning and preprocessing using SQL. This involves handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency.

## Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned data is then imported into Power BI for visualization and analysis. The Power BI dashboard consists of the following pages:

### 1. Batsman Performance

This page displays insights into the top-performing batsmen of IPL 2023, including runs scored, strike rates, and other relevant metrics.

### 2. Bowler Performance

Here, users can explore the performance of bowlers in IPL 2023, focusing on wickets taken, economy rates, and bowling averages.

### 3. All-Rounder Analysis

This page provides a comprehensive analysis of all-rounders, considering both batting and bowling performances. Users can identify top all-rounders based on their contributions with the bat and ball.

### 4. Final 11 Selection

On this page, users can select their best playing XI based on player performances throughout the tournament. The dashboard provides tools for filtering and comparing player statistics to make informed selections.

## How to Use

1. **Data Extraction**: Run the web scraping script using Beautiful Soup to collect IPL 2023 data from relevant websites.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Utilize SQL queries to clean and preprocess the scraped data.
3. **Power BI Visualization**: Import the cleaned data into Power BI and design the dashboard with four pages: Batsman Performance, Bowler Performance, All-Rounder Analysis, and Final 11 Selection.
4. **Interact with the Dashboard**: Users can interact with the Power BI dashboard to explore player statistics, compare performances, and make selections for their final playing XI.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional visualizations and insights, such as team performance analysis and match trends.
- Implement machine learning models to predict player performance or match outcomes.
- Integrate real-time data updates to keep the dashboard current during the IPL season.
